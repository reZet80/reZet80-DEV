-----------------------------------------------------

This is the reset board for the CPU bus (see specs_CPU_bus).

The sole purpose of the reset board is to generate the RESET signal that
initializes the Z80 CPU.
Additionally a power-on reset of about 3 ms is triggered when power is
applied to the system. This frees us from manually pressing the reset button
on start up.

Bill of materials:
- PCB 4x6 cm (at least 5 rows)
- 5-pin right-angled male connector
- DIP-8 socket
- TL7705 supervisor
- tactile push button switch
- resistor 4k7
- capacitor 100 nF
- capacitor 220 nF
