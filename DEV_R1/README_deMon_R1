reZet80 deMon R1 README [last modified: 2020-08-06]
---------------------------------------------------

This is the reZet80 deMon (debug Monitor) R1 (release 1).

The amount of ROM and RAM are checked and displayed on the debug board
(shall be 20H and 20H for the 64 KiB board, "H" for hexadecimal).
The decimal point (DP) on the right tells you to press any key to continue.
Then the date and time are displayed (will be 2000-00-00 and 00:00:00 on
first startup). Again, look out for the DP.

List of available commands:
- "0":        goto 0000h (soft reset)
- "0xxxx":    goto xxxxh (jump to address)
- "1":        show date
- "1WYYMMDD": set date (day of week W, year 20YY, month MM, day DD)
              day of week: 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday
- "2":        show time
- "2HHMMSS":  set time (hour HH, minute MM, second SS, 24-hour format)

Due to the battery backup the system clock continues to work after
system shutdown.
