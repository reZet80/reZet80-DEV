----------------------------------------------

This README describes the reZet80 DEV system.

First of all, reZet80 stands for "Reset me back to the 80s with the Z80".

The reZet80 DEV is a barebone (minimalistic) development system for the
low-level Z80 retro enthusiast.
Its main use is programming in Assembler using the Z80 processor.
The system resembles the Z80 machines of the late 70s and early 80s.
But it is built from scratch and not a copy of any other Z80 system.

The reZet80 DEV builds the foundation for all my coming reZet80 projects.
It involves hardware and software development.
I plan to develop and build every single pcb trace and every single bit
of machine code by myself from scratch.
Doing it yourself is believing (DIYIB)!
And: What you do yourself is what you get (WYDYIWYG)!

The reZet80 DEV includes a Z80 CPU, a motherboard, a power supply socket with
on/off switch, a reset switch, memory, I/O circuitry, a display, a keypad and
of course the monitor software. Pieces of hardware that were not available
back then are also part of the system.
All peripherals are connected directly to the Z80 and no other processor like
for example AVR, PIC or ARM will be used, neither as a bootloader nor to
attach peripherals to.

All we can do in the beginning is enter and display hexadecimal numbers but
the full Z80 instruction set is ready to use.
The DEV runs my own monitor software.

This system will be enhanced on demand for convenience.
