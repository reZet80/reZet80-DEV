---------------------------------------------------

The Z80 is the heart of the system and the CPU board is quite simple.
It connects all 40 CPU pins to the bus.
The signals BUSACK, BUSREQ, HALT, NMI, RFSH and WAIT are optional.

The objective of the CPU bus design is to do without intersections except for
the data pins (they are out of order anyway) and the halt pin that is of no
interest in the current design stage (see specs_CPU_bus).

6 resistors 4k7 are used to pull the signals BUSREQ, CLK, INT, NMI, RESET
and WAIT high.

Additionally an oscillator is available on the board.
With the help of 2 jumpers 2 different clock speeds and 3 configurations
are possible:
- CPU board oscillator for the entire system
- An external oscillator for the entire system
- CPU board oscillator only for the CPU and an external oscillator for the
rest of the system

Bill of materials:
- PCB 12x8 cm (at least 40 rows)
- 40-pin right-angled male connector
- DIP-40 socket (or ZIF-40 socket in order to easily exchange CPUs)
- DIP-8 or DIP-14 socket (depending on oscillator size)
- 20 MHz Z80 CPU DIP-40
- 20 MHz oscillator (DIP-8 or DIP-14)
- 6x resistor 4k7
- capacitor 100 nF
- 2x jumper
