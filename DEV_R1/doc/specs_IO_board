reZet80 I/O board specs [last modified: 2020-09-09]
---------------------------------------------------

This is the I/O board for the I/O bus (see specs_IO_bus).
Both I/O board and I/O bus are optional.

The first 128 I/O ports (00h-7fh) are reserved for internal reZet80 use.
They are divided into 8 regions of 16 ports each by a demultiplexer:

00h-0fh, 10h-1fh, 20h-2fh, 30h-3fh, 40h-4fh, 50h-5fh, 60h-6fh and 70h-7fh.
8 LEDs flash while the corresponding I/O region is selected.

For I/O-demanding systems preparations have been made to divide the regions
10h-1fh and 20h-2fh into 16 single I/O ports each by two additional optional
demultiplexers.

The other 6 regions will be further subdivided on demand.

I/O bus pins 49-80 that are not utilized for I/O can be user-defined.
The signals BUSACK, BUSREQ, HALT, NMI, RFSH and WAIT are also optional.

reZet80 uses 16-bit I/O operations thus most peripheral devices need only
one I/O port.

The remaining 128 I/O ports are free to use: 80h-ffh.
