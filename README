Welcome to reZet80!

reZet80 stands for "Reset me back to the 80s with the Z80".

reZet80 features a set of retro projects to develop computing and
arcade systems that resemble the Z80 machines of the late 70s and early 80s.

All systems are built from scratch and not copies of any other Z80 system.

The development process includes hardware design and low-level software
programming in Assembler.

The reZet80 DEV builds the foundation for all other reZet80 projects.
It's a development system for the low-level Z80 retro enthusiast.

I started reZet80 back in 2016.
reZet80 sets my memories free and resets me back to the 80s with the Z80.
