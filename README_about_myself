About myself
------------

On my sixteenth birthday I got a Spectravideo SV-328 computer.
Assembler was my first true love (I know I sound like a nerd) and my passion
included gaming and programming for the Z80.
Later I still coded in Assembler for x86 but also in C.
As my professional career in software development demanded more and more time
I only managed to develop a few projects like the icepack boot manager and my
Linux distribution icepack linux.
Programming remained a hobby. A few years ago I re-established my early
passions and I started the reZet80 project including multiple subprojects.
It is also worth mentioning that this is my first endeavor at electronics.
My interests: retrocomputing and retrogaming, coding in assembler.
